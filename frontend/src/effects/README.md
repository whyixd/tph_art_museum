# Effect contract

Effects are pure controller-frame renderers. They do not import React、Three.js or browser timing APIs.

The synchronization payload is JSON-compatible:

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": 2,
  "effectId": "center-out-sine",
  "parameters": {
    "speedHz": 0.35
  },
  "color": { "mode": "gradient", "axis": "radius", "colors": [
    { "r": 0.2, "g": 0.92, "b": 1 },
    { "r": 0.66, "g": 0.28, "b": 1 }
  ] }
}
```

Frontend and future backend implementations must use the same inputs:

- `controllerFrame`：40 FPS logical frame index
- `controllerFps`：controller update rate, normally 40
- `ledIndex` / `ledCount`：index over one semicircle (156 LEDs in the current 3D scene)
- `normalizedStripPosition`：0 at one foot of the semicircle and 1 at the other
- `normalizedRadius`：0 at the semicircle apex and 1 at either foot
- `unitIndex` / `unitCount`：目前 unit 的 zero-based index 與場景 unit 總數
- `globalControllerFrame`：未套用 per-unit offset 的共同 frame，供跨 unit choreography 使用
- `unitRelativeY`：燈點相對 unit 中心的 Y 高度，供空間效果使用
- `unitPhaseProjection`：該半圓的估計旋轉相位在垂直方向的投影（-1 到 1）；用於縮短點亮時間，不縮短亮燈長度

Each preset includes a solid color or a gradient with 2–8 evenly spaced colors. `strip` samples from one foot of the semicircle to the other; `radius` samples from apex to feet. `spectrum-cycle` cycles through its gradient over 20 controller frames; in solid mode it cycles brightness over the same period. The preset schema is version 2; version 1 payloads need conversion before synchronization. Each effect returns normalized RGB channels in the 0–1 range. The frontend converts this to Three.js color; the backend can quantize it to RGB/RGBW payload bytes. Effect time is derived from `controllerFrame / controllerFps`, never browser render time, so LED state remains sample-and-hold and can be reproduced by the Raspberry Pi renderer.

`sequential-center-fill` (逐月) uses `globalControllerFrame` to illuminate Unit 1 through Unit 9 in order. The active unit fills from the center toward both outer edges; completed units stay fully lit while the next unit fills. After Unit 9 finishes, all units remain lit.

`periodic-leds` (落雨) lights exactly `litCount` individual LEDs on each semicircle, starting at index 0. Each pair of lit LEDs has `darkGap` unlit LEDs between them. The whole pattern shifts along the semicircle and returns to its starting positions every `periodSeconds`; timing comes from controller frames. The UI limits `litCount` and `darkGap` so the requested LEDs fit within the 156 LED arc.

`random-leds` (隨機亮點) selects exactly `litCount` unique LED indices per semicircle at the start of each `holdFrames` group. A seeded shuffle uses `floor(controllerFrame / holdFrames)` and unit index, so the selection is reproducible across renderers. Both arcs of a unit share the same indices. `durationMode: 0` keeps every selected LED lit for the whole group (the original behavior). `durationMode: 1` turns each LED off after `ceil(holdFrames / (1 + (holdFrames / minHoldFrames - 1) * normalizedRadius))` frames; radius is 0 at the semicircle apex and 1 at either foot. This approximates equal visual streak length while respecting the Art-Net minimum of one whole controller frame. `minHoldFrames` cannot exceed `holdFrames`. If `holdFrames` is one frame, both modes produce the same duration. The actual minimum in milliseconds is `1000 * minHoldFrames / controllerFps`; it changes with the configured FPS.

`world-upper-half` (空間上方 1/3 圓) lights all 78 LEDs from the outer edge to the center on the upper side of a 156-LED arc, only while that side rotates through the top 120° (`abs(unitPhaseProjection) > 0.5`). The inner 20% of the radius fades smoothly toward the center; the LED span and timing do not change. The ID stays unchanged so existing presets remain valid. The simulator estimates phase from nominal RPM at each Art-Net frame boundary and holds the chosen LED pattern until the next frame; the rotor continues rotating in between. Each unit has an unknown startup phase simulated by a reproducible offset. Resetting time selects another offset. At 40 FPS and 360 RPM the rotor turns 54° during each 25 ms hold, so the actual lit duration is quantized to whole frames. This models one possible no-feedback result, assuming nominal motor speed without drift or network jitter.

`moving-rings` (往返光環) moves `ringCount` rings across the whole half: ring `k` is centred at `0.5 + 0.5 * dir * sin(2π speedHz t + πk / ringCount)` (normalized radius, 0 top, 1 bottom), with `dir` alternating +1 / -1, so neighbouring rings travel in opposite directions and pass through each other. Each centre is projected onto the two adjacent radial LED coordinates, whose weights sum to one LED of energy on each side of the apex, so motion has no jumps. With a gradient, ring `k` takes colour `k mod colorCount` (any axis; `gradientColor` hook, backend `ring_weights`) and overlapping rings add their colours; with a solid colour the brightness is the clamped sum of the weights.

For `ringCount = N`, normalized radius is partitioned into `N` non-overlapping lanes. Adjacent rings use opposite sine directions and every shared lane boundary reserves a collision gap of up to two radial LED steps. The innermost lane begins at radius `0` and the outermost lane ends at `1`, so those rings still reach the apex and feet at their respective motion extremes. Even LED counts have no pixel exactly at radius `0`, so the apex is represented by the nearest symmetric LED pair.

`full-on` (全亮) keeps every LED at full brightness with the preset color (solid, or the gradient along its axis); it has no parameters and no cycle, so sequences play it by time.

`random-fill` (隨機填滿) starts dark and lights one LED at a time in a seeded random order (`floor(controllerFrame / cycle)` and unit index, shared by both arcs of a unit). LED `rank` lights at `floor(fill * ((rank + 1) / ledCount) ^ (1 / acceleration))` frames, so the lit count follows `ledCount * (t / fill) ^ acceleration`: slow at first, then faster; `acceleration = 1` is a constant rate. After the fill it holds full brightness and fades out; a unit's round is `unitCycle = fill + ledFade + hold + fadeOut` whole frames. `staggerSeconds` (錯落開始, default 0, the same for every unit) delays each unit's start: the whole cycle is `unitCycle + stagger`, and in round `r` unit `u` starts `round(stagger * order / (unitCount - 1))` frames late, where `order` is its rank in a shuffle seeded by `(r, unitCount, unitCount)`, so the order changes every round and the last unit starts `stagger` frames after the first. A unit is dark before its start and after its own round. Whatever the gradient axis, each unit takes one solid palette color at `((unitIndex * stride) % unitCount) / (unitCount - 1)`, where `stride` is the largest number ≤ `unitCount / 2` coprime with `unitCount` (4 for nine units), so neighbouring units are about half the palette apart.

`two-tone-trail` (雙色拖尾) splits the strip into its two halves (the middle LED at the top, both ends at the bottom). With a gradient the whole strip is lit and the colour shows the dot: on both halves at once a dot runs from the bottom (`normalizedRadius` 1) up to the top (0) and back, one round trip per `periodSeconds`. An LED at radius `r` is passed going up at round-trip phase `(1 - r) / 2` and coming down at `0.5 + r / 2`; with `since` the round-trip fraction since the latest pass, its trail strength is `1 - smoothstep(since / (tailLength / 2))`, since covering a half takes half a round trip. The colour is the gradient sampled at that strength on any axis, so the first colour is the base (red by default), the last is the dot (green) and middle colours appear along the trail. With a solid colour there is no base: brightness is the trail strength. One cycle is one round trip. It has no rain version and ignores the unit index.

`firework-rise` (煙火上升) follows WLED's Meteor, rewritten to need no previous frame. One cycle is `travel + gap` whole frames. With height `1 - normalizedRadius` (0 at both bottom ends, 1 at the top) and `along` the height (or `1 - height` with `direction` 1), the head reaches an LED at frame `along * travel` of the round; before that the previous round's meteor counts (none before the first). An LED is fully lit for `headSize * travel` frames after the head arrives, then fades as `exp(-5.5 * n / (trailSeconds * fps * scale))`, cut to 0 below 1/255, where `scale = max(0.05, 1 + randomness * (2 * hash01(launch, unitIndex, 500 + ledIndex) - 1))`, so each LED and meteor fades at its own rate and the tail breaks up. With `trailColor` 1 the gradient is sampled at `1 - strength` on any axis (the first colour is the head, the tail moves toward the last); otherwise it follows the axis. Its default 2.5 s cycle fits twice into the 5 s round of the ball effect `fixture-firework` (煙火蔓延), which bursts the balls from the lowest to the highest.

The additional phase-free effects use only LED position, controller frame, and (for stardust) unit index. `reverse-tide` draws an inward radial front that fades before restarting. `wide-rings` moves broad radial bands. `comet-tail` moves a head and fading tail along strip order. `stardust-cloud` places deterministic clusters that widen and fade. `color-breathing` pulses brightness while its gradient cycles continuously, so sequence playback uses time rather than a brightness-cycle count. `sector-smear` repeats eight radial lengths; `twenty-beat` repeats five radial profiles in twenty frames. The latter two create drifting smear and do not imply a known physical start angle.

`unit-chase` (逐台巡行) lights one whole unit at a time from unit 1 to unit N, goes dark for `gapSeconds`, then lights pairs `(k, N-1-k)` from both ends inward, holds the centre unit (or centre pair) for `holdSeconds` and stays dark for `endDarkSeconds`. Every stage is whole frames; one cycle is `(N + ceil(N / 2)) * step + gap + hold + endDark`. With `fadeSeconds > 0` each step fades in from its start and out from its end, crossing the neighbouring step.

`unit-random` (隨機單台) lights one whole unit per turn: fade in, hold, fade out, then a dark gap. Each round of N turns visits every unit once in a seeded random order (`randomRanks(round, 1009, unitCount)`); when a round would start with the unit that ended the previous round, its first two turns swap so no unit lights twice in a row. One cycle is one round.

`pillar-fill` (依柱子逐台點亮) lights whole units one by one and keeps them lit. The order is each unit's `unitRank` (`pillarRanks` in `site/layout.ts`, `config.pillar_ranks` in the backend): every spinner belongs to the nearest pole in plan within `ARM_REACH_CM` (120 cm), and units sort by (pole order in the layout, height z, unit), with spinners lacking a pole or position last by unit; without a layout the rank is the unit index. With `span = (N - 1) * step` (step is the average interval), the unit ranked `r` starts fading in at `round(span * (r / (N - 1)) ^ (1 / acceleration))` over `fadeIn`, so acceleration 1 is evenly spaced and higher values start slow and speed up over the same total time; once the last is fully lit they hold, fade out together over `fadeOut` and stay dark for `endDark`, all in whole frames. Like the other whole-unit effects it ignores cloud offsets, has no rain version and no per-unit values.

`roulette-ring` (輪盤收束) lights one whole unit at a time like a roulette ball: from unit 1 it bounces end to end `sweeps` times, then runs to the centre unit `floor((N - 1) / 2)` and stops. Step times grow geometrically from `startStepFrames` (whole frames, at least 1) to `endStepSeconds`; each step is rounded to whole frames and never shorter than the one before. After `holdSeconds` the centre unit darkens from the strip centre outward over `dimSeconds` (each LED goes out within one LED of the moving front), leaving only the outermost LED at each strip end; then every unit's outermost LEDs light from the centre unit outward, one unit distance per `spreadStepSeconds`, hold for `ringHoldSeconds`, then each unit's rim glitches and switches off: every unit starts at a random frame within `glitchSpreadSeconds` (overlaps allowed), flickers on/off for `glitchSeconds` in cells of `flickerFrames` with an on-chance falling from 0.85 to 0.1, then stays off; starts and flicker come from `hash01(round, unit, salt)`, a 32-bit integer hash, so they change every round. It then stays dark for `endDarkSeconds`.

All three share one schedule across units: they set `ignoresWeatherTiming`, so the renderer skips weather cloud offsets and unit frame offsets for them (they have no rain lines either), and per-unit parameter variation is disabled.

## Rain lines

While the weather category is `rain`, `sampleEffect(preset, context, elapsedFrame, true)` uses an effect's optional `rain(context, parameters, base)` brightness instead of the dry one; effects without it are unchanged. The shared building blocks live in `rain.ts` (`RAIN_LINES` matches the backend):

- `rainStripe`: one LED in every `stripeSpacing` (6), counted inward from the rim and mirrored, so it spins into concentric thin rings. Used by `sequential-center-fill`, `reverse-tide` and `color-breathing` on top of their dry brightness.
- `rainRing(radialDistance)`: full within half an LED of the ring and fading over the next one, so the total stays two LEDs of energy and the ring moves smoothly. `center-out-sine` and `sine-swell` keep only their crests; `wide-rings` keeps the inner and outer edge of each band.
- `rainStreak(density)`: each LED lights for one `streakFrames` (2) cell when `hash01(cell, unitIndex, ledIndex + 101) < density`, drawing short arcs. `full-on` uses `sparseDensity` (0.18), `random-fill` uses it only on LEDs its fill has lit, `stardust-cloud` uses `denseDensity` (0.45) times the cloud brightness, and `comet-tail` keeps a thin head ring with tail streaks thinning from `denseDensity` to none.
